# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
This project contains my project submission to the Disaster Response Pipeline project of the Udacity Data Scientist course.

## Prerequisites
This project was built using Python 3.6.3 and imports the following packages:

`Flask` version 0.12.5  
`nltk` version 3.2.5  
`pandas` version 0.23.3  
`plotly` version 2.0.15  
`scikit-learn` version 0.19.1 
`SQLAlchemy` version 1.2.19  

The following command will install these packages according to the configuration file `requirements.txt`.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: the file `requirements.txt` was generated using `pipreqs` and only has information on the imported packages, not their dependencies. The full list of packages (as generated by `pip3 freeze`) is listed in `requirements_full.txt`.

## Execution

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
   ```
   $ python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
   ```
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
   ```
   $ python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
   ```

1. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
   ```
   $ python run.py
   ```

1. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

## Documentation
